Description: Impute missing values in a data matrix using weighted-kNN. Weights
     in w-kNN are specified using a Gaussian kernel, specified by kernlab. v0.4
     introduces parallel computing. v0.6 implements canopies (ie-subsets) with
     approximate solutions for large datasets... Timing tests indicate that the
     current implementation has exponential time complexity. I suggest not
     using canopies on datasets with < ~10^5 observations and using canopies on
     datasets with > ~10^5 observations.
